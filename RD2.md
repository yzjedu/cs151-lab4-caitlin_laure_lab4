Objective:
In this lab, I was supposed to learn and accomplish different types of string methods and formatting, decision making, inputting validation with loops, and ensuring that we had written an algorithm and test cases before coding.

Procedure:
First, Caitlin and I read the readme file closely, making sure we understood everything, and then we wrote an algorithm and test cases. Once these were both approved, we started coding, following our algorithm and making adjustments as needed. There were a few errors along the way but they were not hard to fix. We used many nested if/elif/else statements in our code, along with boolean operators. Organization was much harder and also much more important in this project, so I'm glad we used an algorithm and test cases before everything.

Results:
Our results matched what we expected to get, but only after doing some error correcting. We tried many test cases for every potential variable, including lower case and upper case strings, various package types, and various amounts of data used.

Reflection:
The main challenge that we encountered was organizing our solution to the prompt in a way that it could be turned into code. Even once we understood the problem, it took a bit of thinking to be able to visualize the solution. In doing so, we created multiple drafts of an algorithm and test cases before we did any actual coding, and there was a lot of planning out beforehand. Even once we had finished coding, we double-checked every section for errors, and to make sure that it ran correctly. I believe that I did learn what I was supposed to for this lab. It was very nice working with Caitlin, both in and out of class, and I think we worked together very efficiently.
