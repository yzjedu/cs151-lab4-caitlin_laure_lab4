  * In this lab we were supposed to learn how to implement while statements in our code. We were also supposed to learn how to use f string formatting in out code. The steps we followed were to first work on our algorithm, then work on our test cases, then code, and finally make sure our code works and matches the algorithm. The key concepts explored were while statements, nested if statements, and f strings. The results did match what I expected to get, and we used the test cases to make sure our code was running properly.The main challeneg we ecnountered was the while statement not working properly. We solved that but changing all of the or statements to and statements.I do think I learned what i was supposed to learn in this lab and I enjoyed working with my partner.
